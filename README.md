# Impaired Aire-dependent IFN signaling in the thymus precedes the protective autoantibodies to IFNα

This repository contains code and supporting files for reproducing the analyses and figures presented in the following publication:

**Stoljar, A., Zarodniuk, M. et al.** *Impaired Aire-dependent IFN signaling in the thymus precedes the protective autoantibodies to IFNα.* **J Exp Med (2025)**.

## Overview

The repository includes R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files to reproduce all figures in the study. HTML renders for each of the `.Rmd` files are provided for convenient viewing of the results. All scripts are designed to be reproducible and require only publicly available data and resources.

## Repository Structure

- `html_renders/`  
  Rendered HTML versions of the `.Rmd` files for browsing analysis results without execution.

- `scRNAseq_preprocessing/`  
  Scripts and step-by-step instructions to pre-process single-cell RNA-seq datasets used in the study.

- `data/`  
  Contains supporting data files used in figures.

## Data Availability

All sequencing datasets used in this study have been deposited in the Dryad Digital Repository and can be accessed via the following DOIs:
